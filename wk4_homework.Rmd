  mutate(diff_inequality = gii_2010 - gii_2019)
```

read in spatial data of the World

library(sf)
library(tmap)
WorldMap <- st_read("/Users/qiaoy/Desktop/Geographic Information Systems and Science/wk4/homework/World_Countries_Generalized/World_Countries_Generalized.shp")
qtm(WorldMap)
```

join csv and map

```{r}
#join csv and map
InequalityMap <- WorldMap %>%
  left_join(., 
            InequalityData,
            by = c("COUNTRY" = "country"))
```

mapping

```{r}
#mapping
library(tmaptools)
tmap_mode("plot")
qtm(InequalityMap, 
    fill = "diff_inequality")
```
